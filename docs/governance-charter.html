          <h3>1. Mission</h3>
          <p class="muted">OpenCourts.fyi is a volunteer-run public-interest project dedicated to making court data in North Carolina and South Carolina transparent, accessible, and understandable.</p>
          <p class="muted">Our goal is to support communities, journalists, researchers, and advocates by providing reliable information about how the courts operate.</p>
          <p class="muted">The project is designed as a self-correcting institution that learns, adapts, and improves through open participation and transparent processes.</p>

          <h3>2. Guiding Principles</h3>
          <ul class="muted">
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All data, code, documentation, and governance decisions are public.</li>
            <li><strong>Truthiness evaluation:</strong> We commit to assessing the accuracy, provenance, and reliability of all data we publish, including documenting limitations and uncertainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback loops:</strong> Errors and gaps are surfaced through automated checks and community reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> The platform evolves as courts, laws, and community needs change.</li>
            <li><strong>Pluralism:</strong> Anyone may contribute, review, or challenge data or decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Independence:</strong> No single person or organization controls the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Processes are intentionally lightweight so volunteers can maintain them.</li>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">3.2 Community Contributors</h4>
          <p class="muted">Anyone may submit dashboards, analyses, or data quality reports; propose improvements; participate in discussions; or flag errors.</p>
          <p class="muted">Participation is open, transparent, and asynchronous.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">5.1 Decision-Making</h4>
          <p class="muted">Decisions are made through open discussion on GitHub or public communication channels.</p>
          <p class="muted">Maintainers seek consensus whenever possible.</p>

            <li><strong>Truthiness evaluation:</strong> Data is verified against official sources when possible, uncertainty is documented, and provenance notes are published.</li>
            <li><strong>Public documentation:</strong> Data dictionaries, known issues, and limitations are openly published.</li>

          </ul>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">5.5 Annual Review</h4>
          <p class="muted">Once per year, maintainers publish a short public note summarizing data coverage, improvements, known issues, and plans for the coming year.</p>
          <p class="muted">The review is intentionally brief to respect volunteer capacity.</p>
